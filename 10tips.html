      <br><p> <h5>1.       Gratitude Journal:</h5>

Start your day by writing down at least 3 things you are grateful for every day. This small exercise is a very powerful reminder of everything happy and gives you a positive start to the day.
<br>
<h5>2.       Get at least 8 hours of sleep:</h5>

Your brain too needs to rest to be able to perform better, sharper and full of energy. It is very important to get a good 8 hours of sleep every night as it helps with better stress management and memory improvement too.
<br>
<h5>3.       Keep yourself active:</h5>

At least 30 minutes of exercise 4 times a week is ideal. Physical exercise helps reduce stress. Something as simple as yoga, skipping or just going up and down stairs can do the trick. When you exercise, your body releases chemicals called endorphins that trigger a positive feeling in the body.
<br>
<h5>4.       Pick up a new skill/hobby:</h5>

It is never too late to read that book you have always wanted to or play an instrument you were too scared to pick up, or get creative with drawing and coloring. Starting a new hobby helps keep the brain active and sharp. Added bonus? You have learned a new skill!
<br>
<h5>5.       Do something nice for others:</h5>

Especially when you are feeling low, helping a friend, family members or helping with community work, just volunteer yourself. It helps take the focus away from the stress. This, in turn, will help you feel more positive and less helpless.
<br>
<h5>6.       Get off the grid:</h5>

A lot of us have to Work-From-Home in these tough times and that can add to a lot of stress. Give your electronics a break, disconnect from your emails, alerts and other interruptions for a day and take some time to distress by yourself and try to prioritize your tasks. Spending quality time with your loved ones helps boost positive feelings.
<br>
<h5>7.   Add Omega-3 to your diet:</h5>

Adding Omega-3 fatty acids to your diet is linked to many benefits, some of them being, better memory retention, decreased rates of depression, lower risk of heart diseases to name a few. Fish oil capsules work, but eating your omega-3 in foods like wild salmon, flaxseeds, or walnuts also help build a healthy gut.
<br>
<h5>8.      Practice forgiveness:</h5>

It is hardest to forgive oneself, but here we are talking about the smaller ways in which you can practice forgiveness, even it is forgiving someone who just cut you off while driving on your way to work. People who forgive are known to have better mental health and are more satisfied with their lives.
<br>
<h5>9.       Take time to appreciate someone;</h5>
Not for the sake of it, but when you introspect you realize how often we take people who love us and have been there for us for granted. Take some time to appreciate and thank them. It can be a simple message or a note left on the fridge. Written expressions of gratitude are liked to increase in happiness.
<br>
<h5>10.   Avoid alcohol, cigarettes, and drugs:</h5>

They are not solutions to problems but a temporary distraction from problems. If you have emotional problems, stress you are unable to handle, seek help from your family and friends, or get professional help. Alcohol, drugs, and cigarettes provide temporary solutions, unhappiness and health problems
